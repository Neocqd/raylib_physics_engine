## Introduction

Hello! My name is Néo Coquidé, and this is a basic Physics Engine I created to test my physics skills and deepen my knowledge of C++ and Raylib.

## How to Use

To test the project, follow these steps:

1. **Download Raylib Library**  
   [Click here to download Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).
   
2. **Clone the Repository**  
   Download or clone the repository to your computer.

3. **Set Up Your Environment**  
   - Open the project in Visual Studio.
   - Make sure Raylib is correctly installed and linked to your project.

4. **Run the Project**  
   Press `F5` in Visual Studio to launch the debugger and test the engine. The workspace has already been pre-configured for ease of use.
